                    <p>I am so grateful to Dr. Sheline for his healing guidance and support as I turned my life around in extraordinary ways.  My weight has dropped from 310 to 155 lbs., a level I have maintained for over a year.  I am no longer pre-diabetic, my cholesterol and blood pressure are now perfect, I no longer take antidepressant medication after depending on them for decades, and I have no more problems with arthritis in my knees (quite a surprise for this 67 year old woman).  I move through my day enjoying my body — moving rapidly up and down stairs every day at work, dancing freely twice a week, doing yard work.  I can’t remember a time when I felt stronger.  People have told me that I seem to have the energy of a 25 year old!
<br><br>
                        One of the most important ways Dr. Sheline has helped me is to provide me resources to understand the science behind healthy nutrition, so that I am confident that what I am eating is the best I can do for maintaining my health and living a long life.  I have made big changes in my diet, some of which I did not expect to enjoy.  Yet, I have never enjoyed eating as much as I do now.  I used to always feel that I needed to go hungry in order to maintain a healthy weight.  But I can happily report that with my plant-based diet, I eat when I am hungry.  No more hunger, no calorie counting.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Sheline is simply the most thorough and the most knowledgeable medical practitioner I have known.  His practical, holistic approach as to how to become healthier and how to maintain a healthy lifestyle has helped me to improve my health and feel better in all areas of my life.  The principles that he uses with nutrition and how nutrition directly affects health, are logical and made a big difference to me.   I have worked in the medical field for almost 3 decades and I have seen very few medical providers who are as dedicated to their patients/patient’s health as Dr. Sheline. </p>

                    <p>Dr. Sheline, you saw my husband Stephen a little over a year ago, and we have been vegan ever since. I now passionately believe a whole foods, plant-based diet is the best diet for the human body and our planet.  I am … a Physician Assistant. If you ever find yourself needing help (…to) educate people about this lifestyle, I would be eager to learn from you and help you reach as many people as possible in an effort to change the world. Even if (not), I want to thank you for changing the lives of my little family.  </p>
